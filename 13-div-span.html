    <!-- Definition and Usage
    The <div> tag defines a division or a section in an HTML document.
    The <div> tag is used as a container for HTML elements - which is then styled with CSS or manipulated with JavaScript.
    The <div> tag is easily styled by using the class or id attribute. Any sort of content can be put inside the <div> tag! 
    Note: By default, browsers always place a line break before and after the <div> element. -->

    <!-- Definition and Usage
    The <span> tag is an inline container used to mark up a part of a text, or a part of a document.
    The <span> tag is easily styled by CSS or manipulated with JavaScript using the class or id attribute.
    The <span> tag is much like the <div> element, but <div> is a block-level element and <span> is an inline element. -->
